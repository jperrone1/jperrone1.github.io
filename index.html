 <h1>Hello, everyone!</h1>

<p>Hi, I'm Jeff.</p>

<p>I'm a product developer living in San Francisco. I've been inventing and designing things (products and services) for years.</p>

<p>I have a Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology, and a Master of Science degree in Advanced Technology, which covered Computer Science and System Design. The system design part was really about what I like to call "Advanced Common Sense". It was the study of how to think clearly about the world, and solve problems and make decisions effectively.</p>

<p>I am a trained meeting facilitator. I worked for several consulting firms, including Synectics, Interaction Associates, and SRI International, on group problem solving and new product development.</p>

<p>I was also a Senior Project Manager at E*TRADE Group, the online financial services company. I was responsible for the telephone trading systems, and oversaw implementation of the world's first completely speech-recognition-enabled telephone stock and options trading system. I also co-designed the world's first employee option telephone trading system with speech recognition.</p>

<p>I also worked for myself, doing management consulting, Artificial Intelligence software training, consulting, and marketing, and product licensing and development.</p>

<p>I designed the award-winning PearlSoup.com website, although the site is no longer running. It was a website for sharing true stories of what people had learned about themselves and the world. There were over 14,000 stories on the site. It was one of the very first user-content driven websites.</p>

<p>I hold two patents, and have invented many other things.</p>

<p>I've programmed in many languages, including Forth, Lisp, and C++, and am now learning JavaScript.</p>

<p>I was leading a startup team working on a concept I called the Virtual Hotel in Ruby on Rails when AirBnB launched their site, and my team came apart. Whenever I read about the success of AirBnB, there's a part of me that wants to make sure that I have the skills to pull off the next big idea I have. I've been learning programming, design, and startup skills to that end.</p>

<p>For recreation, I love to bike, and I can frequently be found at the top of Twin Peaks doing loops around the figure-eight, watching the view and the tourists. I typically put in 50 or more miles a week. I also love tropical rain forests, and nature in general. I've visited tropical rain forests in Australia, Costa Rica, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Peru. I'm very interested in visiting forests in Borneo, Madagascar, and perhaps the Central African Republic. I'm fascinated by the incredible complexty of the relationships among the plants, animals, peoples. and geography.</p>

<p>I'm interested in learning web development to get an interesting job and further refine my skills, and perhaps develop one or more of my own websites in the future.</p>
